## T-Shirt Shop

This is a simple e-commerce shop for some cool T-shirts. It consumes a REST API that I developed using `Node.js/Express`, and `MYSQL/Sequelize`. The API is hosted [here](https://shop-tshirt.herokuapp.com/) and this application is hosted [here](https://tee-shop.netlify.com/).

## Functionality
